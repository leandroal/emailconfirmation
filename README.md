# Email Confirmation Sample

The purpose of this sample application is to simulate an automatic confirmation of a user account when a user signs up in a given online service.

Motivation: it is boring to the users when they sign up to an online service and they have to click on a web link available inside an e-mail message received in their inboxes just to confirm that they have typed an valid e-mail address while filling out the form. What about if users fill the sign up fields of the form, submit their data to a server and the application automatically keeps tracking of the confirmation e-mail? This is what we want with this sample.

When the e-mail confirmation is received in a user e-mail inbox, the application grabs the confirmation URL and automatically confirms the user account without any user interaction. In this example, such scenario is simulated as following.

When the user opens the app, (s)he can see the account status. If there no account, the sample application will show the message "Click in the add account button to simulate a new account with automatic e-mail conformation.", as shown below.

As suggested, to simulate a new user sign up, just click on the add account button and fill out the following form:

After that, the application will monitor incoming e-mail messages and, when the proper confirmation message arrives in the user e-mail inbox, it automatically confirms the account by sending an HTTP request to the corresponding web link. If a proper response is returned, the status will be updated to "Account confirmed", as depicted below.

# Diving into the source code

The application is split in two parts: a headless service and a UI application that shows information to the user.

The UI basically just sends a POST request to the server with the informations needed (email and name -- for simplicity, the password is just ignored):

```cpp
void NetworkManager::submit(QString name, QString email, QString password) {
    bool connected = connect(&m_netManager, SIGNAL(finished(QNetworkReply*)), this, SLOT(onFinished(QNetworkReply*)));
    Q_ASSERT(connected);
    QNetworkRequest request(ACCOUNT_URL);
    request.setHeader(QNetworkRequest::ContentTypeHeader, "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
    QUrl parameters;
    parameters.addQueryItem("name", name);
    parameters.addQueryItem("email", email);
    m_netManager.post(request, parameters.encodedQuery());
}
```

The server is supposed to return a confirmation message that the email was sent, so it checks for that:

```cpp
void NetworkManager::onFinished(QNetworkReply* reply) {
    using namespace bb::data;
    bool disconnected = disconnect(&m_netManager, SIGNAL(finished(QNetworkReply*)), this, SLOT(onFinished(QNetworkReply*)));
    Q_ASSERT(disconnected);
    if (reply->error() == QNetworkReply::NoError) {
        JsonDataAccess json;
        QString contentString = reply->readAll();
        qDebug() << "POST reply:" << contentString;
        QVariantMap content = json.loadFromBuffer(contentString).toMap();
        bool ok;
        int replyCode = content["id"].toInt(&ok);
        if (!ok) replyCode = -1;
        if (replyCode == 0) {
            emit emailSent();
        }
    }
    reply->deleteLater();
}
```

After that, the service will catch any incoming messages and check for the sender address. When the right email comes, it will trigger a notification and try to confirm:

```cpp
void MessageHandler::onBodyDownloaded(bb::pim::account::AccountKey accountId, bb::pim::message::MessageKey messageKey)
{
    if (!m_currentAccount.isValid()) {
        return;
    }
    Message msg = m_messageService->message(accountId, messageKey);
    if (msg.isInbound()) {
        if (msg.sender().address() == DEFAULT_EMAIL) {
            QString emailContent = msg.body(MessageBody::PlainText).plainText();
            if (emailContent.isEmpty()) {
                emailContent = msg.body(MessageBody::Html).plainText();
            }
            m_notification.setBody("A new confirmation email just arrived");
            m_notification.notify();

            confirmAccount(emailContent);
        }
    }
}
```

The confirmAccount function parses the URL in the email body and tries to request it. If the result has the right message, it means the email was confirmed.

```cpp
void NetworkManager::onFinished(QNetworkReply* reply) {
    using namespace bb::data;
    bool disconnected = disconnect(&m_netManager, SIGNAL(finished(QNetworkReply*)), this, SLOT(onFinished(QNetworkReply*)));
    Q_ASSERT(disconnected);
    if (reply->error() == QNetworkReply::NoError) {
        JsonDataAccess json;
        QString contentString = reply->readAll();
        QVariantMap content = json.loadFromBuffer(contentString).toMap();
        bool ok;
        int replyCode = content["id"].toInt(&ok);
        if (!ok) replyCode = -1;
        emit confirmationCode(replyCode);
    }
    reply->deleteLater();
```

## Server side scripts

This example requires the use of a server side script. These scripts are available in the scripts folder. The storeuser.php script simulates the user sign up and sends a confirmation e-mail, while the confirm.php scripts simulates the proper account confirmation.
